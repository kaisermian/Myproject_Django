# Django Image Classification Web Application with Transfer Learning

![Django Framework](https://github.com/kaisermian/Myproject_Django/blob/main/git_imgs/Django_Logo.png)

**[Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/)** is a free and open source web application framework written in Python. A framework is nothing more than a collection of modules that make development easier. They are grouped together, and allow you to create applications or websites from an existing source, instead of from scratch.

-----

The web application utilizes **[Django Web Framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/)** in creating the application to integrate the machine learning strategy of image classification by using **[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)** library, *an ene-to-end machine learning open source platform for machine learning* and **[Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras) API**, which is *a high-level deep learning API developed by Google for implementation of Neural Networks*.
